    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>It's the start of Victoria Zhou's personal website!</p>
    <p>I'm a freshman studying computer science at the University of Texas at Austin. I'm honored to be a part of the Turing Scholars (computer science honors program) and Dean's Scholars. When my life is not sucked away by CS, I love to go rockclimb, run (just finished my first 10k!), swim, and go on foodventures with friends.</p>

    <h2>Why I'm doing this:</h2>
    <p>I've always wanted to make my own website and Freetail hacker's 30 day git challenge is exactly what I needed to push me to actually start doing it. :) The challenge is from 4/7/2016 to 5/7/2016.</p>
<p>I hope I can relearn html and learn CSS and Javascript through this process. I also hope this will motivate me more to work on side projects regularly</p>

    <h2>Where you can find me:</h2>
