    <h2>CURRENT PROJECTS </h2>
        <h3>PERSONAL WEBSITE</h3>
          <p> Ayy! That's this! :D </p>
          <p> While this started as part of a 30-day git challenge, it's 
              grown to be a project I love and makes me happy every time I 
              work on it. It gives me a chance to play with the front-end/ 
              aesthetic side of things, that I often don't have the chance to
              do when I'm working on computer architecture and whatnot.</p>
          <p> Through this project, I've been able to relearn html, and dip 
              my foot in the water of css. I can't wait to be able to wade
              through css, javaScript, php, to make this website even better 
              and exciting!</p>
          <hr>
        <h3>ROBOT DETECTION AND FOLLOWING OF INDIVIDUALS</h3>
          <p> I'm working with the Building Wide Intelligence program at the
              University of Texas at Austin to be have the robots (segbots) be 
              able to follow a given individual or object of interest.</p>
          <hr>
        <h3>MATRIX MULTIPLICATION</h3>
          <p> Final project of Computer Architecture CS 429H </p>
          <p> We previously optimized algorithms to make finding how 
              "symmmetric" a matrix was (by utilizing the cache) and wanted to 
              apply learned methods to matrix multiplication with
              multi-threading."  
    <h2>COMPLETED PROJECTS </h2> 
        <h3>WEB CRAWLER</h3>
          <p> Built web crawler and accompanying search engine to return page 
              matches for queries.</p>
          <hr>
        <h3>TETRIS AI</h3>
          <p> Built functional Tetris game—including the board and pieces—and 
              accompanying AI brain to play the game.</p>
          <hr>
        <h3>BOGGLE</h3>
          <p> Made Boggle Word Game—including 2 ways to find all words on 
              board (board search & dictionary search) and UI.</p>
          <hr>
        <h3>RANDOM WRITER</h3>
          <p> Used Markov Chain principle to generate legal English statements 
              by analyzing a given input text; level of coherency depended on 
              level of analysis.</p>
          <hr>
        <h3>IMAGE MANIPULATION</h3>
          <p> Created multiple filter effects for images—removing all red 
              shades, enlarging original size, and replacing each pixel with 
              the average value in its neighborhood.</p>
          <hr>
        <h3>GRID-WORLD GAME</h3>
          <p> Created objects in Grid-World and manipulated them to spin in 
              place, eliminate other objects, and jump across spaces.</p>
