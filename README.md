For Freetail Hacker's 30-Day Git Challenge.

Goal: Start a personal website

Update 1:
I've found that I have forgotten all the html and minimal CSS I had previously learned and have needed to relearn it. It's definitley been hard to find time to work on this project (and my FRI_object_following project) with all of my school work and projects. However, I've come to find my time working on this time to be very stress relieving and rewarding, as the rewards are immediate, and my harshest critic is myself.

Update 2:
I just attended HackDFW this past weekend (4/16-4/17) and am thouroughly sleep deprived. However, this website has recieved some nice updates and looks a lot nicer with actual CSS elements in it. Definitley want to start learning some javaScript/jQuery soon.

Update 3:
Eek! It's definitley hard to find the time to sit down and actually code on projects not related to school stuff. It's time to stress about final projects and final exams, but definitley really want to spend a good chunk of time playing around with CSS and javaScript some more. I've definitely found codecademy and w3school examplese super useful these past few weeks.
